Let's chookie

When I'm alone
When you have left me
I feel so empty
Inside

but
Then you come back
and I'm all happy again
I feel so warm compared
to lonely times back then 

But be-
cause of my personality, I'm
shocked with electricity
And it makes me want
do something pretty pervy

Jacky
That's what I feel 
Jacky
That's what I need
Jacky
What a strange, pervy feeling

Hit it, piano guy

When it is here
When the depressed have come to play
I shake and cry
forever

But you
come and comfort me
I become happy again
I feel so gleeful
Like I've been raised up from the dead

But be-
cause of my personality, I'm
shocked with electricity
And it makes me want
do something pretty pervy

It makes me feel kind of

Jacky
That's what I notice
Jacky
That's what I need
Jacky
What a strange, pervy feeling

Hit it one more time

oo~

Jacky
That's what I feel
Jacky
That's what I need
Jacky
What a strange, pervy feeling
But I like it too
